Important information
COVID-19
We’re taking all measures necessary to make sure you’re protected during your flight. Please visit our COVID-19 information hub to find everything you
need to know when preparing for your flight.

PCR test
Please note that a negative PCR test result certificate might be mandatory for all passengers, including children, to travel on this flight. Please check the
exit and entry requirements of the country you are departing from and arriving in.

Check-in
Find out how you can check in for your flydubai flight. Our online check-in is available between 48 hours and 90 minutes before the flight departure
time (from selected destinations). If you choose to check in online, please note that due to changes in passenger procedures, you’ll still need to go to the
airport check-in counter for us to verify your travel documents and issue your boarding pass. You’ll need to arrive at the airport at least 3 hours before
departure. Check-in closes 60 minutes before departure, boarding starts 45 minutes before your flight and boarding gates close 20 minutes before
flight departure time. If you arrive late, you will not be accepted onto the flight.

Manage booking
You can use 'manage booking' to change your travel dates, add or remove a passenger, upgrade to Business Class or simply add optional extras. Please
check the fare rules attached along with your booking confirmation to see the fees applicable for changing or cancelling your flight(s).
If your booking was made through a travel agent, please contact them directly to make changes to your booking. If you're booked as part of a group,
please check with the group organiser for details on the fare rules, as they may differ from those listed on flydubai.com. For special service requests
with our partner airlines please visit the partner airline website or contact their call centre.

Hand baggage rules
You can carry one item of hand baggage weighing no more than 7 kg in Economy Class and two items of hand baggage with a combined weight not
exceeding 14 kg in Business Class. Each item of hand baggage has to be smaller than 55 cm x 38 cm x 20 cm and you must be able to lift your own hand
baggage into the overhead locker. In addition, you can carry one laptop bag, one small handbag/satchel (not exceeding 25 cm x 33 cm x 20 cm) or one
duty free shopping bag. If the storage available on board your flight is limited, you may be asked to check in your hand baggage at the boarding gate.
Hand baggage exceeding the permitted allowances must be checked in and the relevant baggage fee will apply.

Checked baggage rules
You can check in up to 3 pieces of checked baggage with a combined weight not exceeding the baggage allowance in your booking confirmation. Each
piece of baggage has to weigh less than 32 kg and shouldn’t be larger than 75 cm x 55 cm x 35 cm.

else's credit card, we'll need to see a photocopy of the front of the card and a photocopy of the cardholder's passport. If you are unable to present
these documents, you won't be allowed to travel, and we won't be able to offer you a refund.
A credit card can't be used to pay on behalf of someone else travelling to or from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan and South
